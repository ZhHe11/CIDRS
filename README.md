# IIDRS

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for IIDRS. We apologize for the delay in making this available.

This repository contains the dataset and code implementation utilized in our research paper. For those interested in exploring or utilizing our work, here's what you can find here:

- **Dataset**: Access the dataset used in our study [here](#link-to-dataset). This dataset is crucial for replicating our results and furthering research in this domain.

- **Code Implementation**: Dive into our codebase to see how we've implemented the algorithms and models discussed in the paper. You can find the complete code [here](#link-to-code).

- **Pre-trained Models**: To facilitate ease of use and quick integration, we've made our trained models available [here](#link-to-models). These models are ready to use out of the box for various applications.

- **Interactive Demo**: Experience our work firsthand through an interactive demo hosted on Hugging Face. Try it out [here](#link-to-demo) and see the capabilities of our models in action.
